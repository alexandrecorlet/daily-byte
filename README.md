# Daily Byte Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to coding problems from the **[The Daily Byte](https://thedailybyte.dev)** â€” a collection of short, daily programming challenges designed to prepare you for technical interviews.

Each week, a specific topic is selected (e.g., arrays, strings, trees, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.), and each day of that week features a new problem based on that theme.

### Curriculum

Following are the topics covered in each week:

- Week 1: **Strings**
- Week 2: **Hash Maps**
- Week 3: **Linked Lists**
- Week 4: **Stacks & Queues**
- Week 5: **Trees**
- Week 6: **Breadth-first Search (BFS)**
- Week 7: **Depth-first Search (DFS)**
- Week 8: **Backtracking**
- Week 9: **Greedy Algorithms**
- Week 10: **Memoization**
- Week 11: **Dynamic Programming**
- Week 12: **Advanced Topics**
